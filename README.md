# NusArt - Machine Learning Repository

Overview
This repository serves as a sub-repository of https://github.com/Hanzein/NusArt, containing all machine learning aspects dedicated to the project. It focuses on the multiclass classification of paintings into three primary categories: era, genre, and style. The project utilizes TensorFlow to construct and train three distinct models for each classification task.

Models
1. Era Classification Model
The era classification model is designed to predict the time period to which a painting belongs. It has 12 different classes

2. Genre Classification Model
The genre classification model categorizes paintings into specific genres, capturing the artistic themes and subjects present in the artwork. It has 10 different classes

3. Style Classification Model
The style classification model aims to identify the artistic style of a painting. it has 27 different classes
